Description: Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK
 The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL,
 Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used
 for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it.
 .
 BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various
 ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were
 maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Googleâ€™s product
 portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and
 the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple
 places was growing steadily.
 .
 This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be
 used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked
 into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official
 releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately
 for each project that uses it.
