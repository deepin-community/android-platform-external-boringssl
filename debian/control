Package: android-libboringssl
Architecture: armel armhf arm64 amd64 i386 ppc64el
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK
 The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL,
 Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used
 for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it.
 .
 BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various
 ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were
 maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google’s product
 portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and
 the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple
 places was growing steadily.
 .
 This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be
 used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked
 into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official
 releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately
 for each project that uses it.
